# Improvement Tasks for my-rusty-web

This document contains a prioritized list of improvements for the my-rusty-web project. Each task is designed to enhance the codebase's architecture, maintainability, performance, or security.

## Architecture Improvements

1. [ ] Implement proper environment-based configuration
   - Add support for environment variables
   - Create separate configurations for development, testing, and production
   - Use a configuration library like config-rs

2. [ ] Implement connection pooling for database access
   - Replace single Mutex<Connection> with a proper connection pool (r2d2)
   - Update Database struct to use the connection pool

3. [ ] Implement proper logging
   - Add structured logging with levels (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Use the log crate with an implementation like env_logger or tracing

4. [ ] Reorganize route definitions
   - Move route definitions from main.rs to a separate module
   - Group routes logically by resource or feature

5. [ ] Implement middleware for common concerns
   - Add request logging middleware
   - Add error handling middleware
   - Add authentication/authorization middleware if needed

6. [ ] Add API versioning support
   - Implement versioned API endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/routes)
   - Create a structure that allows multiple versions to coexist

## Code Quality Improvements

7. [ ] Enhance error handling
   - Expand AppError to include more specific error types
   - Improve error messages with more context
   - Add proper error logging

8. [ ] Add input validation
   - Validate route data in handlers before database operations
   - Return appropriate error responses for invalid input

9. [ ] Implement unit tests
   - Add tests for database operations
   - Add tests for handlers
   - Add tests for error handling

10. [ ] Implement integration tests
    - Add end-to-end API tests
    - Set up a test database for integration testing

11. [ ] Add documentation
    - Add documentation comments to public functions and types
    - Create API documentation with examples

12. [ ] Improve the Route model
    - Add validation for the method field (only allow valid HTTP methods)
    - Consider using an enum for the method instead of a String
    - Add created_at and updated_at timestamps

## Performance and Security Improvements

13. [ ] Implement database migrations
    - Use a migration tool like refinery or diesel
    - Create proper versioned migrations for schema changes

14. [ ] Add rate limiting
    - Implement rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse
    - Configure different limits for different endpoints

15. [ ] Implement proper CORS handling
    - Add CORS middleware with appropriate configuration
    - Make CORS settings configurable

16. [ ] Add request and response compression
    - Implement compression middleware for responses
    - Configure compression based on content type

17. [ ] Implement proper database transactions
    - Use transactions for operations that modify multiple records
    - Ensure proper error handling within transactions

18. [ ] Add health check endpoint
    - Create a /health endpoint that checks database connectivity
    - Include version information and system status

## DevOps and Tooling

19. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
    - Add GitHub Actions or similar for continuous integration
    - Implement automated testing on pull requests
    - Set up automated deployment

20. [ ] Add Docker support
    - Create a Dockerfile for the application
    - Add docker-compose.yml for local development
    - Optimize Docker image size and security

21. [ ] Implement code linting and formatting
    - Add rustfmt configuration
    - Add clippy for linting
    - Enforce code style in CI

22. [ ] Add performance monitoring
    - Implement metrics collection
    - Add tracing for performance analysis
    - Set up monitoring dashboards
